    <p>I am an allround web developer. I am a senior programmer with good knowledge of front-end techniques. I love structure and order and I also stand for quality. I love spending time on fixing little details and optimizing web apps. Also I like working in a team, you'll learn faster and much more. As the saying goes: 'two heads are better than one'.</p>
